# Music-Genre-Predictor
This project uses a Decision Tree Classifier to predict music genre preferences based on demographic data, focusing on age and gender. It's designed as a simple, beginner-friendly project to practice machine learning basics, including data preparation, model training, evaluation, and persistence.
# Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:

age: Age of the individual,
gender: Gender (0 for female, 1 for male),
genre: Preferred music genre (HipHop, Jazz, Classical, etc.)

# Result
The model achieves an accuracy score between 75% and 100%, depending on the train-test split. Cross-validation or a consistent random seed can help in evaluating the model's performance more reliably.
